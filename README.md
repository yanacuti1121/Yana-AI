# YAMTAM ENGINE

**Personal agent operating system.**
Hook layer, safety guards, and workflow rules for AI assistants
(Claude Code or other AI coding assistants) operating on arbitrary codebases.

![YAMTAM ENGINE Overview](docs/yamtam-engine-overview.png)

**Version:** 1.3.24
**Status:** Runtime active. 123 checks passing (47 hook + 12 audit + 58 skill + 6 smoke). Release pack live.
**Maintainer:** Vũ Văn Tâm
**Repo type:** Standalone — NOT part of any product repo.

## What YAMTAM is

A pack of bash hooks, scripts, and tests that you drop into a project's
`.claude/` directory to constrain what an AI agent can do:

- Block destructive shell, DB, API, and deploy commands.
- Warn when agent reads secrets/tokens or writes to product directories.
- Enforce evidence before agent claims `done` / `passed` / `clean` (Truth Gate).
- Gate commits touching cross-scope paths; block unauthorized deploys.
- Store verified facts in L1 Atomic Memory; session facts in L2 (gitignored).
- Detect documentation drift and stale claims automatically.
- Log all hook decisions locally with SHA-256 hash-chain audit trail (tamper-evident).
- Track session trust score — Truth Gate violations decrement score; score < 50 requires double evidence.
- Proactively verify claims with `/fact-check`; self-improve skills with `/improve-skill` (human-gated).

## What YAMTAM is not

- Not a product. Not user-facing.
- Not a replacement for production safety (IAM, backups, RBAC).
- Not a full protection layer — see `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` (when imported).
- Not coupled to any single project. Apply to any repo via release pack.
- See `.out-of-scope/` for features deliberately not built.

## How to apply to a project

See `docs/HOOK_WIRING.md` for full wiring guide and `settings.json` presets.

```bash
# Apply latest release pack
unzip releases/yamtam-engine-latest.zip -d /path/to/project/.claude/

# Verify
cd /path/to/project
bash .claude/tests/hooks/run-hook-tests.sh
```

Or install via Claude Code plugin system:
```
/plugin install phamlongh230-lgtm/yamtam-engine
```

---

## How to cut a new release

```bash
# In this repo — after making changes:
bash core/scripts/build-release.sh
# Runs: syntax check → 123 checks → drift check → zip → symlink latest
```

GitHub Actions auto-releases on semver tag push:
```bash
git tag v1.3.24 && git push origin v1.3.24
```
