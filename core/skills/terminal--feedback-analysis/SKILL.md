# Feedback Analysis

## Overview

Collect user feedback from multiple channels, categorize it, extract patterns, and turn it into prioritized product decisions. Build a systematic process from raw input to actionable insight.

## Instructions

### Multi-channel collection

```
PROACTIVE (you ask)
├── In-app surveys (NPS, CSAT, CES)
├── Email campaigns (post-purchase, post-onboarding)
├── User interviews (1:1, 30-60 min)
└── Beta feedback forms

REACTIVE (they tell you)
├── Support tickets (Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk)
├── App store reviews (iOS, Android)
├── Social media mentions (Twitter, Reddit, HN)
└── Community forums (Discord, Slack, GitHub Issues)

BEHAVIORAL (they show you)
├── Session recordings (Hotjar, FullStory)
├── Feature usage analytics
└── Drop-off funnels and search queries
```

### Feedback categorization

Classify every piece of feedback on three dimensions:

```
1. TYPE: Bug report | Feature request | Usability issue | Performance | Praise | Question
2. AREA: Onboarding | Core workflow | Billing | Integrations | Mobile | Account
3. SEVERITY: Critical (blocking) | High (workaround exists) | Medium | Low (nice-to-have)
```

For high-volume feedback (1000+/month), automate classification:

```python
# feedback_classifier.py — LLM-based batch classification

CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """Classify this user feedback:

Feedback: "{text}"

Return JSON:
{{"type": "bug|feature_request|usability|performance|praise|question",
  "area": "onboarding|core_workflow|billing|integrations|mobile|account",
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative",
  "key_theme": "one phrase summarizing the core issue",
  "actionable": true/false}}"""

def classify_feedback(text: str) -> dict:
    """Classify a single feedback item into structured categories."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT.format(text=text)}],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    )
    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Sentiment analysis

**NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: "How likely to recommend? (0-10)". Detractors 0-6, Passives 7-8, Promoters 9-10. NPS = %Promoters - %Detractors. Benchmarks: SaaS +30 good/+50 excellent. The follow-up "Why?" is where insights live.

**CSAT**: "How satisfied with [interaction]?" (1-5). Measured after specific touchpoints. Target: >80%.

**CES (Customer Effort Score)**: "How easy was it to [task]?" (1-7). Best predictor of churn for specific interactions. Users scoring 1-3 are 4x more likely to churn.

### Theme extraction

1. Aggregate all feedback from past 30 days
2. Sample if high volume (200+ items)
3. Tag each item with consistent theme labels
4. Rank themes by frequency
5. Weight: frequency × severity × segment value
6. Cross-reference with behavioral data

**Theme report format:**

```markdown
## Feedback Theme Report — [Month Year]

### Top Themes (by weighted frequency)
| # | Theme | Count | Severity | Top Segment | Sample Quote |
|---|-------|-------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Slow search | 67 | High | Power users | "Search takes 5+ sec on large projects" |
| 2 | Missing CSV export | 52 | Medium | Enterprise | "Need to get data into BI tools" |

### Churn-Correlated Themes
1. Slow search (34% of churners mentioned)
2. Missing integrations (28%)
```

### Feature request prioritization

**RICE Framework:**

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: Users affected next quarter (number)
Impact: 3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal
Confidence: 100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low
Effort: Person-months to build

Example — CSV Export:
Reach: 500, Impact: 2, Confidence: 90%, Effort: 1 month
RICE = (500 × 2 × 0.9) / 1 = 900
```

**Kano Model**: Classify features as Must-have (expected), Performance (more is better), Delighter (unexpected joy), Indifferent, or Reverse (unwanted).

### Feedback-to-action pipeline

```
Raw Feedback → Classify → Tag Themes → Quantify → Prioritize → Build → Close Loop
```

The "Close Loop" step is critical: tell users you heard them, tell them when you ship it. This turns frustrated users into advocates.

## Examples

### Analyze app store reviews for product insights

```prompt
We have 2,400 app store reviews (iOS + Android) from the past 6 months. Export them and analyze for recurring themes, sentiment trends over time, and feature requests. Identify the top 5 issues driving negative reviews and recommend specific product changes. Include a breakdown by star rating and platform.
```

### Build a feedback collection system

```prompt
Our B2B SaaS product has 3,000 active users across 200 companies. We currently collect feedback only through support tickets. Design a multi-channel feedback system — in-app surveys, NPS, feature request portal, and automated review monitoring. Include the timing triggers, question wording, and how to aggregate insights into a monthly report.
```

### Prioritize a feature backlog using user feedback

```prompt
We have 45 feature requests from the past quarter across support tickets, sales calls, and NPS comments. Score each using RICE framework, cross-reference with churn data, and produce a prioritized backlog with the top 10 features to build next quarter. Include the data sources and confidence level for each score.
```

## Guidelines

- Always close the feedback loop — tell users when their requested feature ships
- Use CES (Customer Effort Score) for specific interaction feedback; it's the best churn predictor
- Never rely on a single feedback channel; aggregate from proactive, reactive, and behavioral sources
- Weight feedback by user segment value, not just raw frequency
- Cross-reference qualitative themes with quantitative behavioral data to validate patterns
- Automate classification for high-volume feedback (1000+/month) using LLM batch processing
- Run theme reports monthly and share with product, engineering, and support teams
