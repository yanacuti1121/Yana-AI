# GCP Networking Observability

## Overview

Google Cloud emits multiple network telemetry streams: VPC Flow Logs (sampled IP traffic), firewall rule logs, Cloud NAT translation logs, Cloud Firewall Plus / Cloud IDS threat logs, and aggregated metrics in Cloud Monitoring. Connectivity Tests provide static path analysis for "why can't A reach B?" questions. The right source depends on the question — pick one and stop, do not chase verification across tools.

## Instructions

### Telemetry Streams

| Stream | Use it for |
|---|---|
| **VPC Flow Logs** | Top talkers, bytes/packets between IPs, traffic trends, egress analysis |
| **Firewall Logs** | DENY events, verifying ALLOW rules, audit of who hit which rule |
| **Cloud NAT Logs** | Port exhaustion, source NAT translation auditing |
| **Threat Logs** | Cloud Firewall Plus / Cloud IDS — malicious patterns from deep packet inspection |
| **Networking Metrics** | Time-series throughput, RTT, packet loss for performance dashboards |
| **Connectivity Tests** | Static reachability analysis between two endpoints |

### Enabling VPC Flow Logs

```bash
# Enable flow logs on a subnet (5% sampling, full metadata)
gcloud compute networks subnets update prod-subnet \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --enable-flow-logs \
  --logging-aggregation-interval=interval-5-sec \
  --logging-flow-sampling=0.5 \
  --logging-metadata=include-all
```

```bash
# Route flow logs to BigQuery via a Log Sink (recommended for analysis)
gcloud logging sinks create vpc-flow-sink \
  bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/network_logs \
  --log-filter='resource.type="gce_subnetwork" AND log_id("compute.googleapis.com/vpc_flows")' \
  --use-partitioned-tables
```

### Top-Talker Analysis (BigQuery)

Always prefer **BigQuery on `_AllLogs` datasets** for volume-based queries. Cloud Logging's Logs Explorer is for spot-checking, not aggregation.

```sql
-- Top 20 source→destination IP pairs by bytes (last 24 hours)
SELECT
  jsonPayload.connection.src_ip AS src,
  jsonPayload.connection.dest_ip AS dst,
  jsonPayload.connection.dest_port AS dst_port,
  SUM(CAST(jsonPayload.bytes_sent AS INT64)) AS total_bytes,
  COUNT(*) AS flows
FROM `my-project.network_logs._AllLogs`
WHERE log_id = 'compute.googleapis.com/vpc_flows'
  AND timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
GROUP BY src, dst, dst_port
ORDER BY total_bytes DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Find external egress (to non-RFC1918) by VM
SELECT
  jsonPayload.src_instance.vm_name AS vm,
  jsonPayload.connection.dest_ip AS external_dst,
  SUM(CAST(jsonPayload.bytes_sent AS INT64)) / POW(1024, 3) AS gb_sent
FROM `my-project.network_logs._AllLogs`
WHERE log_id = 'compute.googleapis.com/vpc_flows'
  AND NOT NET.IP_IN_NET(jsonPayload.connection.dest_ip, '10.0.0.0/8')
  AND NOT NET.IP_IN_NET(jsonPayload.connection.dest_ip, '172.16.0.0/12')
  AND NOT NET.IP_IN_NET(jsonPayload.connection.dest_ip, '192.168.0.0/16')
  AND DATE(timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE()
GROUP BY vm, external_dst
ORDER BY gb_sent DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

If the query returns NULL VM names, the subnet has `EXCLUDE_ALL_METADATA` set. Retry using `jsonPayload.connection.src_ip` as the join key.

### Firewall DENY Analysis

```sql
-- Top denied connection attempts (firewall rule + source IP)
SELECT
  jsonPayload.rule_details.reference AS rule,
  jsonPayload.connection.src_ip AS src,
  jsonPayload.connection.dest_port AS port,
  COUNT(*) AS hits
FROM `my-project.network_logs._AllLogs`
WHERE log_id = 'compute.googleapis.com/firewall'
  AND jsonPayload.disposition = 'DENIED'
  AND timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
GROUP BY rule, src, port
ORDER BY hits DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### Connectivity Tests (Static Path Analysis)

```bash
# Test reachability between a VM and an external IP
gcloud network-management connectivity-tests create vm-to-api \
  --source-instance=projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/web-1 \
  --destination-ip-address=203.0.113.10 \
  --destination-port=443 \
  --protocol=TCP

# Run and read the result
gcloud network-management connectivity-tests run vm-to-api
gcloud network-management connectivity-tests describe vm-to-api \
  --format='value(reachabilityDetails.result,reachabilityDetails.traces)'
```

Connectivity Tests answer reachability questions deterministically — no log digging. If the result is `REACHABLE`, the path works; `UNREACHABLE` includes the failing hop and rule.

### Cloud NAT Port Exhaustion

```sql
-- Find which VMs are saturating NAT ports
SELECT
  jsonPayload.endpoint.vm_name AS vm,
  COUNT(*) AS allocations,
  COUNTIF(jsonPayload.allocation_status = 'DROPPED') AS dropped
FROM `my-project.network_logs._AllLogs`
WHERE log_id = 'compute.googleapis.com/nat_flows'
  AND timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 MINUTE)
GROUP BY vm
ORDER BY dropped DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

If `dropped > 0`, increase `min-ports-per-vm` on the Cloud NAT config or add more NAT IPs.

### Networking Metrics (Cloud Monitoring)

```bash
# Pull RTT/latency time series via Monitoring API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  "https://monitoring.googleapis.com/v3/projects/my-project/timeSeries?\
filter=metric.type%3D%22networking.googleapis.com/vm_flow/rtt%22&\
interval.startTime=2026-04-15T00:00:00Z&\
interval.endTime=2026-04-15T01:00:00Z"
```

For dashboards, link the [Flow Analyzer](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-intelligence/flow-analyzer) — it's the fastest way to view top-N traffic without writing SQL.

### Investigation Workflow

1. **Identify the right primary source** for the question:
   - "Why is connection failing?" → Connectivity Tests + firewall logs
   - "Who is sending the most data?" → VPC Flow Logs (BigQuery)
   - "What changed in latency?" → Networking metrics (Monitoring)
2. **Run one query** against the primary source.
3. **Present the answer** — even if the answer is `0`, `null`, or "no traffic." Stop there.
4. Never run a second source to "verify" — different tools have different sampling and aggregation, comparing them creates rabbit holes.
## Examples

### Example 1 — App can't reach a third-party API

User reports their service in `us-central1` can't connect to a payments API. Run a Connectivity Test from the Cloud Run service to the API IP on port 443 — the result names the failing hop (e.g., `firewall-rule deny-egress-public`). Update the rule, rerun the test, confirm `REACHABLE`. No need to dig through firewall logs.

### Example 2 — Surprise egress bill

User sees a $4k spike in egress charges for the month. Query VPC Flow Logs in BigQuery grouped by source VM and external destination IP, ordered by bytes. Top result: a VM exfiltrating 800 GB to a single IP. Cross-check the destination IP against threat intel, kill the VM, file an incident. One query — done.

## Guidelines

- **Pick one source per question** — never query a second tool to "double-check" the first
- **Always use BigQuery on `_AllLogs`** for volume/aggregation queries; Logs Explorer is for spot-checks
- **Print the SQL before running it** — the user should see what you're querying
- **Time-range upfront** — calculate "last 1 hour" / "yesterday" once, don't re-derive
- **Treat `0` / `null` / `no traffic` as a conclusive answer** — don't search for "more interesting" data
- For routine reachability questions, **Connectivity Tests beat log mining** every time
- Enable VPC Flow Logs at 0.5–1.0 sampling for active troubleshooting; 0.05–0.1 for baseline
- Route to BigQuery via Log Sink — Cloud Logging retention costs add up at high volume
- Watch `EXCLUDE_ALL_METADATA` subnets — VM names will be NULL, fall back to IPs
- For NAT port exhaustion, increase `min-ports-per-vm` or scale NAT IPs before app changes
