# Cosign — Container Image Signing and Verification


## Overview


Cosign, the Sigstore tool for signing, verifying, and attaching metadata to container images and other OCI artifacts. Helps developers implement supply chain security by signing images in CI/CD, verifying signatures before deployment, and attaching SBOMs and vulnerability scan results as attestations.


## Instructions

### Sign and Verify Images

```bash
# Install
brew install cosign

# Generate a keypair
cosign generate-key-pair
# Creates cosign.key (private) and cosign.pub (public)

# Sign an image after building
docker build -t myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3 .
docker push myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3
cosign sign --key cosign.key myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3

# Verify before deploying
cosign verify --key cosign.pub myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3

# Keyless signing with Sigstore (no key management!)
# Uses OIDC identity (GitHub Actions, Google, etc.)
cosign sign myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3
# Opens browser for OIDC login, signs with ephemeral key,
# records signature in Rekor transparency log

# Keyless verification
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=user@example.com \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://accounts.google.com \
  myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml — Sign images in CI
jobs:
  build-and-sign:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write                   # Required for keyless signing
      packages: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build and push
        run: |
          docker build -t ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }} .
          docker push ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Install Cosign
        uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3

      - name: Sign image (keyless)
        run: |
          cosign sign \
            --yes \
            ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
        env:
          COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL: 1

      - name: Attach SBOM
        run: |
          # Generate SBOM with syft
          syft ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }} -o spdx-json > sbom.spdx.json

          # Attach SBOM as an attestation
          cosign attest \
            --yes \
            --predicate sbom.spdx.json \
            --type spdxjson \
            ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Attach vulnerability scan
        run: |
          # Scan with grype
          grype ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }} -o json > vuln-scan.json

          # Attach scan results
          cosign attest \
            --yes \
            --predicate vuln-scan.json \
            --type vuln \
            ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
```

### Verify in Kubernetes (Kyverno Policy)

```yaml
# Kubernetes policy: only deploy signed images
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: verify-image-signatures
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: verify-cosign-signature
      match:
        any:
          - resources:
              kinds: ["Pod"]
      verifyImages:
        - imageReferences:
            - "ghcr.io/myorg/*"
          attestors:
            - entries:
                - keyless:
                    subject: "https://github.com/myorg/*"
                    issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
                    rekor:
                      url: "https://rekor.sigstore.dev"
```

### Attestations

```bash
# Attest build provenance (SLSA)
cosign attest \
  --yes \
  --predicate provenance.json \
  --type slsaprovenance \
  myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3

# Verify attestation
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type spdxjson \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=".*@myorg.com" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://accounts.google.com \
  myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3

# Download and inspect attached SBOM
cosign download attestation myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3 | jq -r '.payload' | base64 -d | jq .
```

## Installation

```bash
brew install cosign
# Or: go install github.com/sigstore/cosign/v2/cmd/cosign@latest
# Or: Download from https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases
```


## Examples


### Example 1: Setting up Cosign for a microservices project

**User request:**

```
I have a Node.js API and a React frontend running in Docker. Set up Cosign for monitoring/deployment.
```

The agent creates the necessary configuration files based on patterns like `# Install`, sets up the integration with the existing Docker setup, configures appropriate defaults for a Node.js + React stack, and provides verification commands to confirm everything is working.

### Example 2: Troubleshooting ci/cd integration issues

**User request:**

```
Cosign is showing errors in our ci/cd integration. Here are the logs: [error output]
```

The agent analyzes the error output, identifies the root cause by cross-referencing with common Cosign issues, applies the fix (updating configuration, adjusting resource limits, or correcting syntax), and verifies the resolution with appropriate health checks.


## Guidelines

1. **Keyless signing in CI** — Use Sigstore's keyless signing in GitHub Actions; no key management, signatures tied to OIDC identity
2. **Sign every image** — Sign in CI/CD, verify before deployment; no unsigned image should reach production
3. **Attach SBOMs** — Generate and attach SBOM with every build; required for compliance (Executive Order 14028) and vulnerability tracking
4. **Verify in admission control** — Use Kyverno or OPA to enforce signature verification at the Kubernetes admission level
5. **Rekor transparency log** — Keyless signatures are recorded in Rekor; provides an immutable audit trail of who signed what and when
6. **Attestations for provenance** — Attach SLSA provenance attestations; prove where and how the image was built
7. **Pin by digest** — Reference images by SHA256 digest, not tag; tags can be overwritten, digests are immutable
8. **Vulnerability scan attestations** — Attach scan results as attestations; verify no critical CVEs before deployment
