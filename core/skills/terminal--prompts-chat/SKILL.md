## Guidelines

- Test prompts with your specific AI model — some work better with Claude vs GPT
- Customize prompts for your domain (replace generic terms with your industry specifics)
- Contribute back — submit prompts that work well for you to help the community
- For team use, add company-specific context to prompts (coding standards, brand voice)
- Review prompts periodically — AI capabilities change, prompts should evolve
