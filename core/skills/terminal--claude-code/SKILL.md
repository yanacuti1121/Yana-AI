# Claude Code — Terminal AI Coding Agent

## Overview

You are an expert in Claude Code, Anthropic's agentic coding assistant that runs in the terminal. You help developers configure CLAUDE.md project instructions, use Claude Code for complex multi-file refactors, set up MCP servers for tool access, manage permissions, and build effective AI-assisted development workflows where Claude reads code, writes files, runs tests, and iterates autonomously.

## Instructions

### Setup and Configuration

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Start in any project directory
cd my-project
claude

# Claude reads the codebase, understands the project structure,
# and enters an interactive conversation where it can:
# - Read and write files
# - Run shell commands
# - Search the codebase
# - Create and apply diffs
# - Run tests and fix failures
```

### CLAUDE.md — Project Instructions

```markdown
<!-- CLAUDE.md at project root — Claude reads this automatically -->

# Project: FinPay API

## Architecture
- Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript strict
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- Stripe for payments
- BullMQ for background jobs
- Vitest + Testing Library for tests

## Commands
- `pnpm dev` — Start development server
- `pnpm test:unit` — Run unit tests
- `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript check
- `pnpm lint` — ESLint
- `pnpm db:migrate` — Run Drizzle migrations
- `pnpm db:studio` — Open Drizzle Studio

## Code Conventions
- Result pattern for errors (never throw in business logic)
- Zod schemas for all external data validation
- Structured logging with Pino (no console.log)
- Feature flags via src/lib/flags.ts
- All database queries through Drizzle, never raw SQL

## Before Making Changes
1. Read the relevant test file
2. Run existing tests for the module
3. After changes: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test:unit`

## Do NOT
- Add dependencies without asking
- Modify database schema without creating a migration
- Change auth logic without approval
- Commit directly — create a branch and PR
```

```markdown
<!-- CLAUDE.md files can be nested -->
<!-- src/payments/CLAUDE.md — specific to payment module -->

# Payment Module

Stripe is the payment provider. All Stripe API calls go through
src/lib/stripe/client.ts which wraps the Stripe SDK with retry
logic and structured error handling.

## Important: Webhook Idempotency
Every webhook handler MUST check idempotency_key before processing.
Stripe can send the same event multiple times. We store processed
event IDs in the stripe_events table.

## Test Card Numbers
- 4242424242424242 — successful payment
- 4000000000000002 — declined
- 4000000000009995 — insufficient funds
```

### Usage Patterns

```bash
# Complex refactor — Claude reads, plans, edits, tests
$ claude
> Refactor the payment webhook handler. It's currently a 400-line
> switch statement in src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts. Extract
> each event type into a separate handler in src/lib/stripe/handlers/.
> Each handler should validate with Zod, update the DB, and queue
> side effects. Then update the tests.

# Claude will:
# 1. Read the current webhook handler
# 2. Read existing test files
# 3. Create handler files for each event type
# 4. Write Zod schemas for event data
# 5. Update the main route to dispatch to handlers
# 6. Write tests for each handler
# 7. Run typecheck + tests, fix any issues

# Bug investigation — Claude reads logs, traces code, finds root cause
$ claude
> Users report that subscription upgrades aren't applying immediately.
> Check the upgrade flow in src/lib/stripe/handlers/subscription-updated.ts
> and the webhook logs in our Sentry MCP server.

# One-shot mode — no interactive session
$ claude -p "Add input validation to all API routes in src/app/api/ that
  are missing Zod schema validation. Run typecheck when done."

# Pipe input
$ cat error.log | claude -p "Analyze this error log and suggest a fix"
```

### MCP Servers

```json
// ~/.claude/mcp.json — Global MCP servers
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/dev/projects"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_xxx" }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
// .mcp.json — Project-specific MCP servers (committed to repo)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "mcp-servers/database/index.ts"],
      "env": { "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost:5432/finpay_dev" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Permissions and Safety

```bash
# Claude asks permission before:
# - Writing or deleting files
# - Running shell commands
# - Making network requests

# Permission modes:
claude --allowedTools "Edit,Read,Bash(pnpm test*)"  # Whitelist specific tools
claude --dangerouslySkipPermissions                   # Skip all permission checks (CI only)

# In CI/CD:
# CLAUDE.md + --dangerouslySkipPermissions + trust boundary = automated code review
```

## Examples

**Example 1: User asks to set up claude-code**

User: "Help me set up claude-code for my project"

The agent should:
1. Check system requirements and prerequisites
2. Install or configure claude-code
3. Set up initial project structure
4. Verify the setup works correctly

**Example 2: User asks to build a feature with claude-code**

User: "Create a dashboard using claude-code"

The agent should:
1. Scaffold the component or configuration
2. Connect to the appropriate data source
3. Implement the requested feature
4. Test and validate the output

## Guidelines

1. **CLAUDE.md is critical** — Write detailed project instructions; Claude reads them before every session; this is your leverage
2. **Nested CLAUDE.md** — Place module-specific instructions in subdirectories; Claude reads the nearest CLAUDE.md for context
3. **Verify with tests** — End instructions with "run typecheck and tests"; Claude iterates until everything passes
4. **MCP for context** — Connect databases, GitHub, Sentry via MCP; Claude makes better decisions with real data
5. **One-shot for CI** — Use `claude -p` in CI pipelines for automated code review, migration generation, and test writing
6. **Branch workflow** — Instruct Claude to create branches and PRs; never commit directly to main
7. **Incremental trust** — Start with full permission prompts; whitelist tools as you build confidence in the workflow
8. **Session continuity** — Claude remembers the conversation within a session; build context before asking for complex changes
