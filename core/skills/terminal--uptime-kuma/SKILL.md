# Uptime Kuma

Self-hosted monitoring tool for tracking service availability with alerts and status pages.

## Setup

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d --name uptime-kuma --restart always \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v uptime-kuma-data:/app/data \
  louislam/uptime-kuma:1
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  uptime-kuma:
    image: louislam/uptime-kuma:1
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - uptime-kuma-data:/app/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro  # Optional: Docker monitoring

volumes:
  uptime-kuma-data:
```

Dashboard at `http://localhost:3001`. Set admin credentials on first visit.

## Monitor Types

### HTTP(S)

```
URL: https://api.example.com/health
Method: GET
Expected status: 200
Interval: 60 seconds
Timeout: 10 seconds
Retries: 3                    # Retry before alerting (avoids false positives)
Accepted status codes: 200-299
```

### HTTP with Keyword

More reliable than status-code-only — verifies the response body contains expected content:

```
URL: https://api.example.com/health
Expected keyword: "status":"ok"
```

Catches cases where a reverse proxy returns 200 but the actual application is down.

### TCP Port

```
Host: db-server.internal
Port: 5432
Interval: 60 seconds
```

Good for databases, Redis, SMTP, and any TCP service.

### DNS

```
Hostname: example.com
Record type: A
Expected value: 93.184.216.34
DNS server: 8.8.8.8
```

Detects DNS hijacking or propagation issues.

### Docker Container

Requires Docker socket mounted (`/var/run/docker.sock`):

```
Container name: my-api
Expected status: running
```

Monitors container health status directly — catches OOM kills, restart loops, and crashes.

### Ping (ICMP)

```
Host: 192.168.1.1
Interval: 60 seconds
```

### gRPC

```
URL: grpc://api.example.com:50051
Service name: health.v1.HealthService
```

## Notifications

### Slack

1. Create Incoming Webhook at api.slack.com/apps
2. Add notification in Uptime Kuma → Slack type
3. Paste webhook URL
4. Customize message template

### Email (SMTP)

```
SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com
Port: 587
Security: TLS
Username: monitoring@example.com
Password: app-specific-password
From: Uptime Kuma <monitoring@example.com>
To: oncall@example.com
```

### Telegram

```
Bot Token: from @BotFather
Chat ID: your chat/group ID
```

### Discord

```
Webhook URL: from channel settings → Integrations → Webhooks
```

### Webhook (generic)

```
URL: https://your-endpoint.com/alerts
Method: POST
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {
  "monitor": "{{ monitorJSON }}",
  "message": "{{ msg }}",
  "heartbeat": "{{ heartbeatJSON }}"
}
```

### PagerDuty / Opsgenie

Use the webhook notification type with the provider's event API endpoint.

## Status Pages

Public-facing pages showing service health:

1. Status Pages → Add New
2. Configure:
   - **Title**: "Platform Status"
   - **Description**: "Real-time status of all services"
   - **Theme**: Auto / Light / Dark
   - **Show tags**: Optional
3. Add monitor groups:
   - Group 1: "Core Platform" → API, Dashboard monitors
   - Group 2: "Website" → Marketing site
   - Group 3: "Database" → PostgreSQL, Redis (or hide internal services)

### Custom Domain

Point `status.example.com` to the Uptime Kuma server. Configure reverse proxy:

```caddyfile
status.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3001
}
```

### Incident Management

Create incidents manually from the status page:

1. Status Page → Create Incident
2. **Title**: "API Degraded Performance"
3. **Content**: "We're investigating increased response times..."
4. **Style**: Info / Warning / Danger / Primary
5. Update as incident progresses, resolve when fixed

Incidents show on the status page with timestamps and updates — customers see you're aware and working on it.

## Maintenance Windows

Prevent false alerts during planned downtime:

1. Maintenance → Add
2. **Strategy**: Manual / Single / Recurring / Cron
3. **Affected monitors**: Select which monitors to suppress
4. **Cron example**: `0 2 * * 0` (every Sunday at 2 AM)

During maintenance:
- No alerts fire for affected monitors
- Status page shows "Scheduled Maintenance"
- Uptime calculations exclude maintenance periods

## API

Uptime Kuma has a Socket.IO-based API. For HTTP API, use the community REST API wrapper or automate via the dashboard:

```javascript
// Programmatic monitor management via Socket.IO
const { io } = require("socket.io-client");

const socket = io("http://localhost:3001");

socket.emit("login", { username: "admin", password: "secret" }, (res) => {
  if (res.ok) {
    // Add a new monitor
    socket.emit("add", {
      type: "http",
      name: "New API",
      url: "https://new-api.example.com/health",
      interval: 60,
      retryInterval: 30,
      maxretries: 3,
      accepted_statuscodes: ["200-299"],
      notificationIDList: { 1: true },  // Link to notification channel ID
    }, (res) => {
      console.log("Monitor added:", res);
    });
  }
});
```

## Backup and Restore

Data stored in SQLite database at `/app/data/kuma.db`:

```bash
# Backup
docker cp uptime-kuma:/app/data/kuma.db ./kuma-backup-$(date +%F).db

# Restore
docker stop uptime-kuma
docker cp ./kuma-backup.db uptime-kuma:/app/data/kuma.db
docker start uptime-kuma
```

## Guidelines

- **Keyword checks over status-code checks** — a reverse proxy can return 200 when the backend is down. Keyword verification catches this.
- **Set retries to 2-3** — single-check failures are often network blips. Retrying reduces false alerts.
- **Different intervals for different criticality** — production API: 60s, marketing site: 300s, internal tools: 600s
- **Monitor from outside your network** — if Uptime Kuma runs on the same server as your services, a server crash takes down monitoring too. Ideally, monitor from a separate machine.
- **Keep status pages simple** — customers don't need to see "Redis Cache" or "Worker Process." Group monitors into customer-facing categories.
- **Maintenance windows prevent alert fatigue** — false alerts during deploys train the team to ignore alerts. Always set maintenance windows for planned work.
- **Back up `kuma.db` regularly** — all configuration, history, and uptime data is in one SQLite file. Easy to back up, easy to lose.
- **Use Docker socket monitoring for containers** — TCP port checks only verify the port is open. Docker monitoring catches OOM kills, health check failures, and restart loops.
