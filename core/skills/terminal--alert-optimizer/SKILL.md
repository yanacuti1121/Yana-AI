# Alert Optimizer

## Overview

This skill takes error analysis data (ideally from the `error-monitoring` skill) and generates optimized alert rules, severity tiers, escalation policies, and on-call runbooks. It turns a noisy alerting setup into a structured incident response system.

## Instructions

### 1. Understand Current State

Ask for or infer:
- Current monitoring platform (Sentry, Datadog, PagerDuty, etc.)
- Current alert volume and on-call team size
- Notification channels available (Slack, PagerDuty, email, SMS)
- Any existing severity definitions

### 2. Define Severity Tiers

Create a three-tier model (unless the user specifies otherwise):

| Tier | Criteria | Response Time | Channel |
|------|----------|---------------|---------|
| P1 - Critical | Revenue impact, data loss, security breach, >50% users affected | Immediate page | PagerDuty/SMS |
| P2 - Warning | Degraded experience, >5% users affected, error rate spike | 1 hour | Slack channel |
| P3 - Info | Known issues, cosmetic errors, self-healing transients | Weekly review | Log only |

### 3. Generate Alert Rules

For each error group, produce a platform-specific alert configuration:
- **Sentry**: JSON alert rule with conditions, filters, and actions
- **Datadog**: Monitor definition with query, thresholds, and notification targets
- **PagerDuty**: Event rules with severity mapping and escalation policy
- **Generic**: Webhook payload template with routing logic

### 4. Create Escalation Policies

Define who gets notified and when:
- P1: On-call engineer immediately → team lead after 10 min → engineering manager after 30 min
- P2: Post to team Slack channel → on-call acknowledges within 1 hour
- P3: Aggregated weekly digest

### 5. Generate Runbooks

For each P1 alert, create a runbook with:
- **What**: One-sentence description of the alert
- **Why it matters**: Business impact
- **Diagnose**: First 3 steps to investigate
- **Fix**: Common resolutions
- **Escalate**: When and to whom

## Examples

### Example 1: Sentry Alert Rules

**Input**: Error audit showing PaymentProcessingError as P1, RedisTimeout as P3.

**Output**:
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "P1: Payment Processing Failure",
      "conditions": [
        {"id": "sentry.rules.conditions.event_frequency", "value": 1, "interval": "5m"}
      ],
      "filters": [
        {"id": "sentry.rules.filters.tagged_event", "key": "error_type", "value": "PaymentProcessingError"}
      ],
      "actions": [
        {"id": "sentry.integrations.pagerduty.notify_action", "service": "engineering-oncall"},
        {"id": "sentry.integrations.slack.notify_action", "channel": "#incidents", "tags": "environment,transaction"}
      ],
      "frequency": 5
    },
    {
      "name": "P3: Redis Connection Timeout (Log Only)",
      "conditions": [
        {"id": "sentry.rules.conditions.event_frequency", "value": 100, "interval": "1h"}
      ],
      "filters": [
        {"id": "sentry.rules.filters.tagged_event", "key": "error_type", "value": "TimeoutError"}
      ],
      "actions": [],
      "frequency": 1440
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: On-Call Runbook Entry

**Input**: P1 alert for database deadlocks.

**Output**:
```markdown
## RUNBOOK: Database Deadlock Detected

**Alert**: DatabaseError: deadlock detected in order processing
**Severity**: P1 — Revenue impact, orders fail silently
**Response**: Immediate — acknowledge within 5 minutes

### Diagnose
1. Check current DB connections: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' ORDER BY query_start;`
2. Identify locked queries: `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;`
3. Check if deployment happened in last 30 min (new query pattern?)

### Common Fixes
- Kill the blocking query: `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<pid>);`
- If recurring post-deploy: rollback last migration
- If load-related: enable connection pooling or add read replica

### Escalate
- If not resolved in 15 min → page team lead
- If data corruption suspected → page engineering manager + DB admin
```

## Guidelines

- Always deduplicate alert rules — one root cause should trigger one alert, not five
- Set reasonable frequency caps: P1 alerts should re-fire every 5 minutes max, P3 should be daily at most
- Include "auto-resolve" rules where appropriate (e.g., error rate drops below threshold)
- Runbooks should be copy-pasteable — include actual commands, not pseudocode
- When the user has fewer than 3 people on-call, simplify escalation to two tiers
- Test configurations by asking the user to dry-run before applying
