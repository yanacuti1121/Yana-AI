# GDPR Compliance

## Overview

This skill helps AI agents implement GDPR compliance across web applications. It covers the full lifecycle: auditing where personal data lives, building consent management, handling data subject requests (access, deletion, portability), enforcing retention policies, and generating documentation.

## Instructions

### PII Audit

1. Scan database schemas (Prisma, SQL migrations, Sequelize models, TypeORM entities) for PII fields. Flag these patterns:
   - Direct identifiers: `email`, `name`, `full_name`, `phone`, `address`, `ssn`
   - Indirect identifiers: `ip_address`, `device_id`, `geo_*`, `lat`, `lng`, `user_agent`
   - Sensitive data: `date_of_birth`, `gender`, `health_*`, `ethnicity`
2. Scan application code for PII in logs: search for `console.log`, `logger.*`, `winston.*` calls that include user objects or request IPs.
3. Scan third-party integrations: check for API calls that send user data (analytics, email providers, payment processors, CRMs).
4. Output a **Data Flow Inventory** as a markdown table:
   | Data Type | Storage Location | Shared With | Legal Basis | Retention Period |

### Consent Management

1. Define consent categories:
   - `strictly_necessary` — always active, no consent needed
   - `functional` — preferences, language, UI settings
   - `analytics` — usage tracking, performance monitoring
   - `marketing` — ad targeting, remarketing pixels
2. Build a consent banner component that:
   - Blocks all non-necessary scripts until consent is granted
   - Provides granular opt-in/opt-out per category
   - Stores consent in a database table (not just cookies)
3. Consent record schema:
   ```
   consent_records: id, user_id, version, strictly_necessary (always true),
   functional (bool), analytics (bool), marketing (bool),
   ip_address_hash, created_at
   ```
4. On consent change, fire a `consent_updated` event that other services can listen to for enabling/disabling tracking.

### Data Subject Requests (DSR)

Implement three endpoints:

**Data Export (Right of Access / Portability):**
- Collect all data for the user across all tables where their ID appears.
- Include related records (orders, comments, sessions).
- Return as JSON with a clear structure. Optionally offer CSV.
- Redact any third-party secrets or internal IDs that are not user data.

**Data Deletion (Right to Erasure):**
- Do NOT immediately delete. Use a 30-day cooling-off queue.
- Send confirmation email with a cancel link.
- After 30 days, either anonymize (replace PII with hashed/null values) or hard-delete.
- Cascade to: logs (redact), sessions (delete), third-party (trigger deletion APIs where available).
- Keep anonymized records for aggregate analytics if needed.

**Consent History:**
- Return all consent records for the user, ordered by date.
- Include version numbers to show what the user agreed to and when.

### Retention Policies

1. Define retention periods per data type based on purpose:
   - Session data: 90 days
   - IP addresses: 30 days (anonymize by zeroing last octet)
   - Soft-deleted accounts: 30 days then hard delete
   - Audit logs: 1 year (legal requirement)
   - Marketing data: until consent withdrawn
2. Build a scheduled job that runs daily and enforces these policies.
3. Always implement dry-run mode first: log what would be affected without deleting.

### Privacy Policy Generation

1. Use the Data Flow Inventory to auto-generate a privacy policy that lists:
   - What data is collected
   - Why (legal basis for each type)
   - How long it is kept
   - Who it is shared with
   - User rights and how to exercise them
2. Use plain language — avoid legal jargon where possible.
3. Include placeholder sections for: company name, DPO contact, supervisory authority.

## Examples

### Example 1 — PII detection in Prisma schema

**Input:** "Audit this Prisma schema for PII."
```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String
  phone     String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  orders    Order[]
}
```

**Output:**
```
PII fields found in model User:
- email (direct identifier) — requires legal basis, retention policy
- name (direct identifier) — requires legal basis
- phone (direct identifier) — requires legal basis, consider encryption at rest

Recommendations:
1. Add a `deletedAt` field for soft-delete support
2. Add a `consentVersion` field to track which privacy policy version the user agreed to
3. Consider encrypting `phone` at rest using application-level encryption
```

### Example 2 — Data deletion cascade

**Input:** "Build a deletion handler for a user account."

**Output:**
```js
async function handleDeletionRequest(userId) {
  // 1. Create deletion request record
  await db.deletionRequest.create({
    data: { userId, status: 'pending', expiresAt: addDays(new Date(), 30) }
  });

  // 2. Send confirmation email with cancel link
  await emailService.send(userId, 'deletion-confirmation', {
    cancelUrl: `${BASE_URL}/api/privacy/cancel-deletion?token=${token}`
  });

  // 3. After 30 days (triggered by cron job):
  // await db.user.update({ where: { id: userId }, data: {
  //   email: `deleted-${hash}@anonymized.local`,
  //   name: 'Deleted User', phone: null
  // }});
  // await db.session.deleteMany({ where: { userId } });
  // await analyticsService.deleteUser(userId);
}
```

## Guidelines

- **GDPR compliance is not just technical.** Always recommend the client consult a legal professional for their specific jurisdiction.
- **Default to opt-out.** In the EU, analytics and marketing require explicit opt-in. Never pre-check consent boxes.
- **Anonymize over delete when possible.** Anonymized data is no longer personal data and can be kept for analytics.
- **Log every DSR.** Regulators may ask for proof that requests were handled within the 30-day deadline.
- **Test deletion cascades thoroughly.** Missing a single table or third-party integration means non-compliance.
