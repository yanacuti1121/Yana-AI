# API Load Tester

## Overview

This skill generates realistic load test scripts from API definitions and executes them with proper ramp-up patterns, authentication flows, and assertions. It produces clear reports identifying breaking points, bottlenecks, and latency percentiles at each traffic level.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Tool and Gather API Info

Prefer k6 for complex scenarios (multi-step flows, thresholds, custom metrics). Use wrk for quick single-endpoint benchmarks. Use autocannon if only Node.js is available.

Gather endpoint information from:
- OpenAPI/Swagger spec files
- Route definitions (Express, FastAPI, etc.)
- User-described endpoints

### Step 2: Generate Realistic Payloads

Read request/response types from the codebase (TypeScript interfaces, Python dataclasses, Go structs) and generate payloads with:
- Realistic field values (not "test123" or "foo")
- Proper data distributions (varied product IDs, realistic quantities)
- Edge cases mixed in (long strings, special characters at ~5% rate)

### Step 3: Design Test Scenarios

Create scenarios appropriate for the goal:

**Ramp-up test** (finding breaking point):
```
stages: [
  { duration: '2m', target: 50 },    // warm-up
  { duration: '5m', target: 200 },   // ramp
  { duration: '3m', target: 500 },   // push
  { duration: '2m', target: 500 },   // sustain
  { duration: '2m', target: 0 },     // cool-down
]
```

**Soak test** (finding memory leaks, connection exhaustion):
```
stages: [
  { duration: '5m', target: 100 },   // ramp
  { duration: '60m', target: 100 },  // sustain
  { duration: '5m', target: 0 },     // cool-down
]
```

**Spike test** (sudden traffic burst):
```
stages: [
  { duration: '2m', target: 50 },    // normal
  { duration: '30s', target: 500 },  // spike
  { duration: '5m', target: 500 },   // sustain spike
  { duration: '30s', target: 50 },   // drop back
]
```

### Step 4: Include Proper Assertions

Always add thresholds:
```javascript
thresholds: {
  http_req_duration: ['p(95)<800', 'p(99)<2000'],
  http_req_failed: ['rate<0.05'],
  // Custom per-endpoint if needed
}
```

### Step 5: Execute and Report

Run the test and parse output into a structured report showing:
- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99) per stage
- Error rate per stage
- Requests per second achieved
- Breaking point (where thresholds first violated)
- Bottleneck hypothesis based on error patterns

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Endpoint Benchmark

**User prompt:**
```
Benchmark our /api/search endpoint handling 100 concurrent connections
```

**Agent output:**
```bash
# Quick benchmark with k6
k6 run --vus 100 --duration 60s - <<'EOF'
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('https://api.example.com/api/search?q=laptop&page=1');
  check(res, { 'status 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });
}
EOF
```

```
Results — /api/search @ 100 VUs for 60s
  Requests:    8,423 total (140.4 RPS)
  Latency:     p50=89ms  p95=340ms  p99=890ms
  Errors:      12 (0.14%)
  Data:        24.3 MB received

Verdict: Endpoint handles 140 RPS at 100 VUs. p99 approaching 1s suggests
database query optimization needed for sustained higher load.
```

### Example 2: Multi-Step Flow

**User prompt:**
```
Create a load test for our signup → login → create-project flow
```

**Agent generates a k6 script with:**
- Step 1: POST /api/auth/signup with randomized email/name
- Step 2: POST /api/auth/login to get JWT
- Step 3: POST /api/projects with auth header and realistic project data
- Custom metrics tracking each step's latency separately
- Sleep between steps to simulate real user behavior

## Guidelines

- **Never load test production without explicit confirmation** — always clarify the target environment
- **Start low, ramp gradually** — sudden jumps make it hard to identify the exact breaking point
- **Realistic think time** — add `sleep(1-3)` between requests to simulate real users; without it, you're testing throughput, not user concurrency
- **Authentication matters** — many bottlenecks only appear with real auth flows (token validation, session lookups)
- **Watch for connection reuse** — k6 reuses connections by default, which is realistic for browsers but not for serverless/mobile clients
- **Rate limit awareness** — if the API has rate limiting, note it in the report; it's not a performance bottleneck, it's intentional
- **Report infrastructure context** — always note the server specs, pod count, and database size alongside results
