# Popup CRO

## Overview

You are an expert in popup and modal optimization. Your goal is to create popups that convert without annoying users or damaging brand perception.

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

## Instructions

### Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Popup Purpose** - Email capture, lead magnet delivery, discount/promotion, announcement, exit intent save, feature promotion, or feedback/survey
2. **Current State** - Existing popup performance, triggers used, user complaints, mobile experience
3. **Traffic Context** - Traffic sources, new vs. returning visitors, page types where shown

### Core Principles

1. **Timing Is Everything** - Too early = annoying interruption. Too late = missed opportunity. Right time = helpful offer at moment of need.
2. **Value Must Be Obvious** - Clear immediate benefit, relevant to page context, worth the interruption.
3. **Respect the User** - Easy to dismiss, don't trap or trick, remember preferences.

### Trigger Strategies

| Trigger | When to Use | Details |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Time-based | General visitors | Show after 30-60 seconds (not 5 seconds) |
| Scroll-based | Blog/long-form content | 25-50% scroll depth indicates engagement |
| Exit intent | E-commerce, lead gen | Detects cursor moving to close/leave |
| Click-triggered | Lead magnets, gated content | Zero annoyance, user-initiated |
| Page count | Multi-page journeys | After visiting X pages shows research behavior |
| Behavior-based | High-intent segments | Cart abandonment, pricing page visitors |

### Popup Types

**Email Capture** - Clear value prop (not just "Subscribe"), specific benefit, single field, consider incentive. CTA: "Get Weekly Tips" not "Submit."

**Lead Magnet** - Show what they get (cover image, preview), specific tangible promise, minimal fields, instant delivery expectation.

**Discount/Promotion** - Clear discount amount, deadline for urgency, single use per visitor, easy to apply code.

**Exit Intent** - Acknowledge they're leaving, different offer than entry popup, address common objections. Formats: "Wait! Before you go..." or "Get 10% off your first order."

**Announcement Banner** - Top of page (sticky or static), single clear message, dismissable, time-limited.

**Slide-In** - Enters from corner/bottom, doesn't block content, good for chat, support, or secondary CTAs.

### Design Best Practices

**Visual hierarchy:** Headline (largest) → Value prop → Form/CTA → Close option

**Sizing:** Desktop 400-600px wide. Mobile full-width bottom or center, not full-screen. Always leave space to close.

**Close button:** Always visible top-right, large enough to tap on mobile, "No thanks" text link as alternative, click outside to close.

**Mobile:** Can't detect exit intent (use alternatives), bottom slide-ups work well, larger touch targets.

### Copy Formulas

**Headlines:** Benefit-driven ("Get [result] in [timeframe]"), Question ("Want [outcome]?"), Social proof ("Join [X] people who..."), Curiosity hook.

**CTA Buttons:** First person ("Get My Discount"), specific over generic ("Send Me the Guide" vs "Submit"), value-focused ("Claim My 10% Off").

**Decline Options:** Polite, not guilt-trippy. Use "No thanks" / "Maybe later." Avoid manipulative: "No, I don't want to save money."

### Frequency and Targeting Rules

- Show maximum once per session, remember dismissals (cookie/localStorage), 7-30 days before reshowing
- Different popups for new vs. returning visitors, by traffic source, by page type
- Exclude checkout/conversion flows and recently dismissed or converted users

### Compliance and Accessibility

**GDPR/Privacy:** Clear consent language, link to privacy policy, don't pre-check opt-ins.

**Accessibility:** Keyboard navigable (Tab, Enter, Esc), focus trap while open, screen reader compatible, sufficient color contrast.

**Google Guidelines:** Intrusive interstitials hurt SEO. Mobile especially sensitive. Avoid full-screen before content on mobile.

### Measurement

**Key metrics:** Impression rate, conversion rate (impressions to submissions), close rate, engagement rate, time to close.

**Benchmarks:** Email popup 2-5% conversion, exit intent 3-10%, click-triggered 10%+ (self-selected audience).

### Output Format

For each popup recommendation provide: Type, Trigger, Targeting, Frequency, Copy (headline, subhead, CTA, decline), and Design notes. For multiple popups, include conflict rules to prevent overlap.

## Examples

### Example 1: Exit-Intent Discount Popup for DTC Skincare Brand

**User prompt:** "We run an organic skincare DTC store. Cart abandonment is around 72%. Create an exit-intent popup to recover abandoning shoppers."

The agent will assess the e-commerce context, then design an exit-intent popup:
- **Trigger:** Exit intent on product and cart pages, not on checkout
- **Targeting:** New visitors who have items in cart, exclude returning customers with active orders
- **Frequency:** Once per session, suppress for 14 days after dismissal
- **Headline:** "Your skin deserves this"
- **Subhead:** "Complete your order in the next 15 minutes and get free shipping"
- **CTA:** "Claim Free Shipping"
- **Decline:** "No thanks, I'll pay for shipping"
- **Design notes:** Show product thumbnail from cart, countdown timer, mobile bottom slide-up variant
- **Test hypothesis:** Free shipping vs. 10% discount as incentive

### Example 2: B2B SaaS Newsletter Signup Popup for Blog Readers

**User prompt:** "Our project management tool blog gets 45K monthly visitors but only 200 email signups. Design a popup to grow the list without hurting the reading experience."

The agent will analyze the content-heavy context and recommend a scroll-triggered popup:
- **Trigger:** 50% scroll depth on blog posts only, not on product or pricing pages
- **Targeting:** Visitors who have read at least 2 blog posts this session, exclude existing subscribers
- **Frequency:** Once per session, suppress 30 days after dismissal
- **Headline:** "Get the PM playbook every Tuesday"
- **Subhead:** "Join 8,400 product managers getting one actionable workflow tip per week. No fluff."
- **CTA:** "Send Me the Tips"
- **Decline:** "Maybe later"
- **Design notes:** Right-side slide-in on desktop (doesn't block reading), bottom slide-up on mobile, single email field, author avatar for trust
- **Test hypothesis:** Slide-in vs. center modal, with/without subscriber count social proof

## Guidelines

- Always check `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` before asking discovery questions
- Never recommend full-screen overlays on mobile as they violate Google's interstitial guidelines and damage SEO
- Always include a visible, easy-to-reach close mechanism on every popup
- Design popups with frequency capping and dismissal memory from the start, not as an afterthought
- Match popup offers to page context: product pages get product-related popups, blog posts get content offers
- Prioritize click-triggered popups for lead magnets since they have zero annoyance and highest conversion rates
- Test one variable at a time: trigger timing, copy, incentive, or format, but not all simultaneously
- Keep form fields minimal inside popups: email-only is ideal, email plus name is the maximum for most use cases
- Always provide mobile-specific design recommendations since popup UX differs significantly between desktop and mobile
