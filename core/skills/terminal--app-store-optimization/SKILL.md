# App Store Optimization (ASO)

## Overview

Optimize mobile app visibility and conversion in App Store and Google Play. Cover keyword research, metadata optimization, creative assets, ratings management, and localization.

## Instructions

### How store algorithms work

**Apple App Store** indexes: App Name (30 chars, highest weight), Subtitle (30 chars), Keyword field (100 chars, hidden), In-App Purchase names, Developer name. Apple does NOT index the description for search.

**Google Play** indexes: App Title (30 chars, highest weight), Short Description (80 chars), Long Description (4000 chars, 2-5% keyword density), Developer name, Package name. Google also factors engagement metrics: install velocity, retention, crash rate, uninstall rate.

### Keyword research

1. **Seed list**: Features, use cases, competitor names, problem words
2. **Expand**: Use autocomplete in both stores
3. **Validate**: Check volume and difficulty (AppTweak, Sensor Tower, AppFollow)
4. **Prioritize**: Score each on `volume × relevance / difficulty`
5. **Map**: Assign keywords to metadata fields by priority

**Keyword placement:**

```
App Store (iOS):
- App Name (30 chars): Top 2-3 keywords, natural reading
- Subtitle (30 chars): Supporting keywords, value prop
- Keyword field (100 chars): Everything else, no duplicates across fields
- Comma-separated, no spaces. Singular OR plural (Apple matches both)
- Don't include "app" or category name. Don't use competitor brands.

Google Play:
- Title (30 chars): Primary keyword + brand
- Short Description (80 chars): Key features with keywords
- Long Description (4000 chars): Natural usage, 2-5% density, repeat 3-5x
```

### Store listing creative assets

**Screenshots** are the single biggest conversion factor. Design principles:
- First 3 screenshots visible without scrolling — strongest value props here
- Each screenshot = one clear message (feature + benefit)
- Large, readable text overlay
- Sequence: Hero shot → Core feature → Unique differentiator → Secondary feature → Social proof

**Preview video**: iOS 15-30s (autoplays muted), Android 30s-2min (YouTube). Start with the wow moment, no long intros.

**Icon**: Recognizable at 16×16px, single focal element, avoid text, A/B test variations.

### A/B testing store listings

**Google Play Experiments**: Test up to 5 variants (icon, screenshots, descriptions). Minimum 7 days, recommend 14 days.

**Apple Product Page Optimization**: Test up to 3 treatments (icon, screenshots, preview video). Cannot test title/subtitle. 90-day limit.

**Priority order**: Screenshots → Icon → Short description/subtitle → Preview video.

### Ratings and reviews

Each 0.5-star increase improves conversion by 10-20%. Apps below 4.0 lose significant traffic.

**In-app review prompts**: Use native review API. Trigger after positive actions (completed goal, saved money). Pre-qualify: ask "Are you enjoying [App]?" — if yes, show review; if no, route to feedback form. Max 3 times per year (iOS enforced).

**Responding**: Reply to all negative reviews within 24-48 hours. Be specific about fixes. Never argue or be defensive.

### Localization

Localizing metadata (not the app) is the fastest ASO win. High-impact locales: Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, German, French, Korean.

Localization is NOT translation — research keywords in each locale separately. Direct translations often aren't what locals search for.

### Monitoring

Track weekly: keyword rankings (top 10 with position changes), category ranking, impressions, page view → install rate (benchmark: 25-35%), impression → install rate (benchmark: 3-8%), Day 1 retention, crash rate, current rating and trend.

## Examples

### Optimize an iOS app listing for more downloads

```prompt
Our meditation app "ZenFlow" has 2,000 daily downloads but a 22% conversion rate from page views. Current title: "ZenFlow". We rank for "meditation" (#45) and "sleep sounds" (#78). Optimize our App Store metadata — title, subtitle, and keyword field — to improve keyword rankings and conversion. Research what top competitors in the meditation category use.
```

### Plan a localization strategy for Google Play

```prompt
Our fitness app has 100K downloads in the US and we want to expand internationally. Identify the top 5 markets by opportunity (considering competition, ARPU, and mobile fitness trends), then create localized metadata for each — not direct translations, but locally researched keywords and culturally adapted screenshots.
```

### Design a screenshot A/B test

```prompt
Our productivity app's screenshots haven't been updated in 8 months and conversion is declining. Design 3 screenshot variants to A/B test on Google Play. Include the messaging strategy, visual approach, and success metrics for each variant. Our current conversion rate from page view to install is 28%.
```

## Guidelines

- Always deduplicate keywords across title, subtitle, and keyword field on iOS — Apple deduplicates automatically
- Use singular or plural forms but not both on iOS (Apple matches both)
- Never include competitor brand names in the keyword field — risk of rejection
- Update screenshots and metadata at least every 3-6 months to avoid conversion decline
- Always pre-qualify users before showing the native review prompt
- Respond to negative reviews with specific fix information, never defensively
- Track keyword rankings weekly and iterate metadata based on position changes
