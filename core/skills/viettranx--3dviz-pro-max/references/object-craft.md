# Object craft: form, material and motion

Use this reference when object quality matters: a close-up creature, an architectural scene, a scientific cutaway, a product, or an interactive assembly. Detail should reveal the object's identity and construction. Adding more objects does not repair weak modeling of the important ones. These are artistic prompts, not mandatory density scores or a prescribed style.

## Design the object before scattering it

Choose the object's role and nearest useful viewing distance. Define a recognizable silhouette, its major connected masses, and the parts that deserve attention. A hero object should reward inspection; distant supporting objects can be simpler. A deliberately minimal mathematical form can be complete without surface decoration.

Think at three scales:

- **Silhouette:** proportion, posture, profile, major openings and asymmetry. A mill, inn and observatory should remain distinguishable without relying on color. Distinct creature species need different skeletons and body proportions, not recolored copies.
- **Construction:** overlapping roof courses, window recesses, door jambs, frame joints, wing membranes, hooves, antlers, bone landmarks, teeth and bearings. Parts should connect in a readable way and have plausible thickness for the chosen visual language.
- **Surface:** grain direction, seam placement, edge treatment, finish variation, worn contact areas or soft fur masses. Spend this detail where it survives the actual camera scale. Avoid uniform noise, random scratches or gratuitous subdivision.

Model silhouette-changing details as geometry. Shading detail can support smaller features; it cannot repair a missing outline, joint, cavity or opening.

## Choose continuity at the join

When a model looks assembled from unrelated lumps, inspect the intended relationship at the weak
join. A body's shoulder may need one flowing skin; feathers need overlapping layers; a bearing and
shaft need distinct surfaces and clearance. Choose by the object and its motion, not by a blanket
preference for one mesh. Separate meshes can be deliberate, and a single mesh can still contain
intersecting shells.

| Observed weakness | Useful intervention | Preserve while refining |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accidental seams or bulges across one intended skin | Author shared surface sections, bridge suitable boundaries, or selectively union/remesh volumes | Silhouette, volume, landmarks and deformation needs |
| Duplicate or redundant internal geometry | Remove faces confirmed unnecessary for the intended views and behavior | Cavities, cutaways, backs revealed by motion, shadow and transmission needs |
| Disconnected-looking feather, tile or armor layers | Refine roots, overlap order, thickness and spacing | Meaningful layering rather than fusing the covering into a blob |
| Pinching or faceted highlights | Inspect normals, winding, local curvature and topology before adding polygons | Intended creases and material boundaries |

Choose the smallest construction change that addresses the visible defect. Blender modeling,
sculpting or selective remeshing and Three.js custom surfaces or suitable geometry operations are
all options. An implicit reconstruction can soften detail or change the silhouette; inspect those
tradeoffs before accepting it. A closed result does not establish good deformation topology.

Three.js `mergeGeometries` combines compatible buffers; `mergeVertices` merges sufficiently similar
vertex attributes. Neither performs a solid Boolean union or automatically removes interior faces.
Preserve intended UV and normal seams when welding. See the official
[BufferGeometryUtils documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/module-BufferGeometryUtils.html)
(read 2026-09-10; verify the installed version when implementing).

Use neutral material and oblique/close views when they help distinguish shape defects from shading.
Check affected joins at relevant motion extremes. Boundary-edge and duplicate-face diagnostics can
guide cleanup, but cannot certify the absence of self-intersections or judge artistic quality.
These are conditional repair choices, not required manifoldness, polygon-count or fusion gates.

## Give materials distinct behavior

Choose a small material family for the object and a reason for each assignment. Specify base appearance, roughness, metallic response where appropriate, transparency/transmission if useful, and the scale/direction of surface features. Inspect those choices under the actual lighting, including close views. Do not make every surface the same glossy plastic with a different color.

| Object family | Useful artistic decisions | Common weak result to repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Timber and masonry | Beam ends, board grain along members, recessed mortar, varied stone sizes, restrained edge wear | Flat cream box with brown strips; random stone texture without structural joints |
| Roof and glasshouse | Overlapping tiles, ridge/eaves, visible frame depth, separated glass panes, interior silhouettes | Paper-thin roof; opaque filler box hiding everything behind nominally transparent glass |
| Mythical animals | Species-specific body masses, muzzle/eyes, ear roots, paws/claws, layered feathers or fur tufts, segmented tails | Floating spheres with identical cone ears; wings that rotate without a shoulder |
| Mechanical assembly | Distinguishable housing, shafts, teeth, bearings, fasteners and contact surfaces | Teeth that look convincing but intersect or move with the wrong ratio |
| Scientific anatomy | Sourced landmarks and attachments, meaningful layers, section thickness and restrained material separation | Decorative grooves mistaken for anatomy; invented tissue or impossible attachment |
| Mathematical/logic object | Crisp boundaries, consistent axes, purposeful transparency, readable labels and state-dependent emphasis | Decorative effects obscure the invariant or imply unsupported physical properties |

For Three.js, its [standard material documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/MeshStandardMaterial.html) describes the metallic/roughness workflow and distinguishes normal-map shading from displacement geometry. The [physical material documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/MeshPhysicalMaterial.html) describes transmission, clearcoat, sheen and their additional rendering cost. Choose effects for the required appearance; using a PBR material alone does not establish physical accuracy. Documentation read 2026-09-07; verify APIs against the project's installed version before implementation.

## Develop a material direction

For a custom finish that still feels generic, research references that resolve the missing choice:
material close-ups, collection objects, art direction or a supplied palette. Extract useful color
relationships, finish contrast, grain direction and feature scale instead of merely collecting
texture files. Use supplied references first when sufficient; a small recolor need not become a
research project. Established scientific claims still follow [research and truth](research-and-truth.md).

Translate the reference into assignments on the actual object: dominant and accent regions, which
parts are soft or coated, where roughness changes, and how texture follows the construction.
For example, a pale body, darker layered covering and restrained metal accents can clarify different
parts; this is one option, not a required palette. Preserve data legends and scientific color meanings.

Choose authored procedural detail, painted/baked maps or sourced textures by fit. Match feature
scale and direction to the surface and intended camera distance; uniform noise does not establish
fur, wood or feathers. Verify mapping after geometry changes. Keep asset rights and provenance when
using external files, and distinguish authored color/roughness choices from measured material values.

Inspect material separation under the final lighting. If the contribution is unclear, hold geometry,
camera, exposure and pose fixed while comparing surface treatments; use neutral material separately
to inspect construction. An A/B comparison is optional, not a deliverable every scene owes. Accept
improvements supported by the visible result and user feedback without treating palette, mesh closure
or shader complexity as proof that every part is finished.

## Make articulation belong to the object

Place local pivots at meaningful attachments. Parent parts so a moving limb carries its foot, a shoulder carries its wing, and a shaft carries its wheel. Separate authoritative state from visual interpolation. Derive coupled mechanical parts from their shared state or constraint, not independent oscillations that merely look active.

For invented creatures, vary gait, cadence, stride and secondary motion by morphology. Let a heavy deer and a hovering owl feel different. Check foot contact, route height, turns and collisions with buildings. A decorative route can be authored rather than simulated, but should not visibly pass through a wall. Wings need visible root articulation, tails can have delayed motion, and eyes/heads can guide attention without all creatures bobbing identically.

For established science, research the allowed motion and attachments before animating. A stylized knee is not a generic door hinge; a flow arrow is not evidence of a fluid simulation. Keep illustrative choices explicit and preserve the sourced structural relationships.

## Diagnose deformation at the region that fails

Separate four questions: does the control or solver reach the intended state; does skin preserve
its intended shape there; do attached parts remain seated; and does the final surface read well?
Correct IK endpoints and normalized weights answer only part of this. A claw needs an intentional
root, exposed length and orientation relative to its digit, not merely the same parent node.

When a region pinches, inspect the affected exported vertices and their resolved joint names.
Define the region using its part identity and meaningful spatial extent: a broad belly selection
can accidentally include low toe tips. Check the selection visually before trusting its statistics.
Inspect nearby regions that should remain unaffected as well as the region being repaired.

Choose a remedy from the observed cause:

| Evidence | Construction decision to reconsider |
| --- | --- |
| Wrong distant joint influences a region | Part ownership and local influence domain before normalization |
| Visible crease follows a weight boundary | Continuity and location of the blend relative to the actual joint and muscle mass |
| Correct joints still squash the form at a bend | Deformation topology, rest shape, joint placement, or a suitable supported corrective/deformation method |
| Attached nail, trim or plate slides away | Its seat and the underlying surface's actual deformation, not just shared parenting |
| Detailed texture still reads as clay or noise | Primary form and secondary folds/interfaces; then region-specific surface scale and light response |

Skeletal skinning, corrective morphs and physical soft-tissue simulation serve different purposes.
Choose what the scene needs and what survives the authoring-to-runtime handoff; do not claim muscle
physics from an authored deformation. No particular skinning algorithm, topology, tool or numeric
weight threshold is prescribed here.

Watch a complete motion cycle when the artifact has one, then inspect meaningful extremes,
transitions and any user-reported interval closely. Sparse evenly spaced poses can miss a short
failure. Use informative angles, pausing or scrubbing as needed; this is not a fixed frame count or
an instruction to launch headless automation. After a repair, revisit the failing state and adjacent
states plus affected neighbors. Report the observed coverage rather than a universal visual pass.

Repeated local fixes that move the defect elsewhere are a cue to re-evaluate the representation:
regional ownership, topology, rest pose or deformation method may need revision. Prefer that inquiry
to accumulating coordinate exceptions. Reuse shared diagnostics and export tooling; distinguish a
repair of one asset from a reusable rule supported by more than that asset's particular dimensions.

## Review at the scales the viewer can use

Inspect a composed overview and a close view of each important object family, plus a frame during motion. Ask what the viewer can identify, how materials separate, whether joints remain attached, and whether the next useful interaction is visible. Exercise Play, Step, Reset or equivalent actions when the scene teaches a change; a technically working slider can still leave the experience looking inert.

[templates/checklists/inspection-per-frame.md](../templates/checklists/inspection-per-frame.md) lists the captures a scene owes and the per-frame checks to run on each one; work through it once the frames exist.

`knowledge.hero-detail-ladder-defaults` and the kit proofs provide examples tuned for their stated
objects and views. Their architectural feature counts and distances are not universal quality gates.
Inspect what makes the current subject convincing: an anatomical attachment, a readable vector or a
satin silhouette may matter more than bevels and wear. Choose kit, adapted kit, custom geometry or
sourced geometry by fit; do not route every failed close-up back to a kit.

Iterate on the weakest important object before adding incidental props. Simplify details that shimmer, obscure meaning or exceed the delivery medium. Keep room for stylized, painterly, low-poly, sculptural and experimental choices: craftsmanship means deliberate execution, not mandatory realism.
