# Product Strategy — Vision, Positioning, and Roadmap


## Overview


Product strategy, helping product leaders define product vision, craft positioning, analyze competitive landscapes, choose pricing models, and build outcome-driven roadmaps. This skill applies frameworks from Marty Cagan (Empowered), April Dunford (Obviously Awesome), Gibson Biddle (DHM Model), and Reforge.


## Instructions

### Product Vision and Strategy

```markdown
## Define Product Strategy

Product strategy answers: "How will we win?"
It connects the company mission to the product roadmap through a clear logic chain.

### Strategy Stack (top → bottom)

1. **Company Mission**: Why does this company exist?
   Example: "Make financial tools accessible to every small business"

2. **Product Vision** (3-5 year): What does the world look like if we succeed?
   Example: "Every small business manages finances as easily as a Fortune 500 company"

3. **Strategic Pillars** (1-2 year): What big bets are we making?
   Example:
   - Pillar 1: AI-powered bookkeeping (automate 90% of manual entries)
   - Pillar 2: Embedded banking (checking, cards, loans inside the product)
   - Pillar 3: Ecosystem (accountant collaboration, app marketplace)

4. **Outcomes** (quarterly): What measurable outcomes will we drive?
   Example: "Increase autopilot adoption from 20% to 60% of active users"

5. **Features/Initiatives**: What will we build to achieve outcomes?
   (This is the LAST level — most teams start here; that's the mistake)

### DHM Model (Gibson Biddle)
For each strategic pillar, answer:
- **D**elight: How does this delight customers in hard-to-copy ways?
- **H**ard-to-copy: What creates a moat? (Network effects, data, brand, scale)
- **M**argin-enhancing: How does this improve unit economics?

If a feature scores low on all three, it's probably not strategic.
```

### Positioning (April Dunford Framework)

```markdown
## Craft Product Positioning

Positioning defines how customers should think about your product.
Bad positioning = great product that nobody understands.

### 5 Components of Positioning

1. **Competitive Alternatives**: What would customers use if you didn't exist?
   Not just direct competitors — include spreadsheets, manual processes, hiring.
   Example: "Spreadsheets, QuickBooks, hiring a part-time bookkeeper"

2. **Unique Attributes**: What can you do that alternatives can't?
   Be specific. "Better UX" is not a unique attribute.
   Example: "AI categorizes 95% of transactions automatically using your
   industry-specific patterns"

3. **Value**: What benefit does the unique attribute deliver?
   Map each attribute to a customer outcome.
   Attribute: "AI auto-categorization" → Value: "Save 8 hours/month on bookkeeping"

4. **Target Customer**: Who cares most about that value?
   The segment where your unique attributes matter most.
   Example: "Solo founders running service businesses with <$2M revenue
   who do their own books"

5. **Market Category**: What frame of reference helps customers understand you?
   Options:
   - Existing category: "AI-powered accounting software"
   - Subcategory: "Autopilot bookkeeping for solopreneurs"
   - New category: "Financial copilot for small business"

### Positioning Statement Template
"For [target customer] who [key need], [product] is a [category]
that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], we [key differentiator]."

Example:
"For solo founders who spend 8+ hours/month on bookkeeping,
FinBot is an autopilot bookkeeping tool that categorizes transactions
and generates reports automatically. Unlike QuickBooks, we require
zero manual data entry after initial setup."
```

### Competitive Analysis

```markdown
## Analyze Competitive Landscape

### Direct vs Indirect Competitors
- **Direct**: Same solution, same customer (QuickBooks vs Xero)
- **Indirect**: Different solution, same problem (spreadsheets, hiring a bookkeeper)
- **Potential**: Adjacent products that could enter your market (Stripe, Shopify)

### Analysis Framework

For each competitor, assess:

**Product**: Core features, UX quality, platform coverage
**Positioning**: Who they target, how they describe themselves
**Pricing**: Model (freemium, per-seat, usage), price points, free tier
**Distribution**: How they acquire users (SEO, sales, partnerships, PLG)
**Moat**: What makes them hard to displace (data, network effects, brand, switching costs)
**Weakness**: Where do their users complain? (G2 reviews, Reddit, Twitter)

### Strategic Response Options
1. **Differentiate**: Serve a different segment or solve a different job
2. **Outexecute**: Same market but significantly better product
3. **Reframe**: Change the category so comparison isn't apples-to-apples
4. **Niche down**: Own a narrow segment completely before expanding

### Competitive Positioning Map
Plot competitors on a 2×2 where axes are the two attributes
your target customers care most about:
- X: Ease of use ←→ Power/flexibility
- Y: Price ←→ Premium
Find the empty quadrant. That might be your positioning.
```

### Pricing Strategy

```markdown
## Design Pricing

### Pricing Models
- **Freemium**: Free tier + paid upgrades (Slack, Notion, Figma)
- **Per-seat**: Charge per user (Jira, Salesforce)
- **Usage-based**: Charge per API call, GB, transaction (AWS, Twilio, Stripe)
- **Flat-rate tiers**: Fixed price per tier (Basecamp, Netflix)
- **Hybrid**: Per-seat + usage (HubSpot, Datadog)

### Choose Your Value Metric
The value metric is what you charge for. It should scale with
the value the customer receives.

Good value metrics:
- Stripe: % of transaction volume (they make money when you make money)
- Twilio: per message sent (scales with usage)
- Figma: per editor (viewers are free — viral loop)

Bad value metrics:
- Per feature (customers feel nickel-and-dimed)
- Per GB stored (no correlation with customer value)

### Pricing Page Framework
**Tier 1 — Free/Starter**: Enough to experience core value. Goal: acquisition.
**Tier 2 — Pro**: For serious users. Contains the "aha" premium features. Goal: revenue.
**Tier 3 — Enterprise**: Custom pricing. Compliance, SSO, SLA, dedicated support.

### Pricing Research
- **Van Westendorp**: Ask 4 questions about price perception
  "At what price is this too expensive? A bargain? Expensive but worth it? Too cheap?"
- **Conjoint Analysis**: Show bundles of features at different prices; measure preference
- **Competitor benchmarking**: Where do alternatives price? Price 20-30% different.
```

### Outcome-Driven Roadmap

```markdown
## Build an Outcome-Driven Roadmap

### Why Not Feature Roadmaps
Feature roadmaps commit to solutions before understanding problems.
"Build feature X by Q3" → What if X doesn't move the metric?

Outcome roadmaps commit to results:
"Reduce churn from 8% to 5% by Q3" → Team discovers the best solution.

### Roadmap Structure
**Now** (this quarter): Committed outcomes with active experiments
  - Outcome: Reduce onboarding drop-off from 60% to 35%
  - Key initiatives: Interactive setup wizard, template gallery
  - Evidence: 3 user interviews showed confusion at step 3

**Next** (next quarter): Planned outcomes, solutions TBD
  - Outcome: Increase expansion revenue by 20%
  - Hypothesis: Power users need team collaboration features
  - Evidence needed: Interview 10 accounts with 3+ users

**Later** (2-3 quarters): Strategic bets, low confidence
  - Outcome: Enter enterprise segment
  - Open questions: What compliance requirements? What deal size?

### Stakeholder Communication
- Engineers: share the outcome + constraints, let them propose solutions
- Sales: share "Now" and "Next" with confidence levels
- Executives: share outcomes linked to company OKRs
- Customers: share themes ("We're investing in collaboration") not features
```


## Examples


### Example 1: Creating a product vision and strategy for a new product

**User request:**

```
We're launching a project management tool for remote design teams. Help me create a product vision and strategy.
```

The agent applies the Product Strategy framework, asking clarifying questions about target audience, market positioning, and business model. It produces a structured deliverable with specific, actionable recommendations tailored to the design-tools market, including competitive positioning and key metrics to track.

### Example 2: Analyzing competitive positioning

**User request:**

```
We're a B2B analytics platform competing against Amplitude and Mixpanel. Help us find our differentiated positioning.
```

The agent analyzes the existing work against product strategy best practices, identifies missing elements, weak assumptions, and areas that need validation. It provides specific suggestions with reasoning, not generic advice, referencing the frameworks and patterns from the instructions above.


## Guidelines

1. **Strategy before roadmap** — Define vision, positioning, and strategic pillars before deciding what to build
2. **Positioning is a choice** — You can't be everything to everyone; choose your target customer and own that position
3. **Competitive analysis is ongoing** — Review competitors quarterly; track their product launches, pricing changes, and positioning shifts
4. **Price on value, not cost** — Charge based on the value delivered to the customer, not the cost to build the feature
5. **Outcome roadmaps** — Commit to outcomes (reduce churn by 3%), not features (build feature X); outcomes give teams freedom to find the best solution
6. **Strategic pillars = focus** — Limit to 3-4 pillars per year; saying no to good ideas is the hardest part of strategy
7. **DHM for prioritization** — Test every big bet against Delight, Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing; if it scores zero on all three, skip it
8. **Strategy ≠ a plan** — Strategy is a set of choices about where to play and how to win; it should fit on one page
