# NDA Generator

## Overview

Generate professional Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) tailored to specific business contexts. This skill creates legally structured NDA documents covering confidentiality terms, obligations, duration, exclusions, and remedies. Supports mutual and unilateral NDAs for employment, partnerships, meetings, and contractor engagements.

## Instructions

When a user asks to create or generate an NDA, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the NDA type and context

Identify what kind of NDA is needed:
- **Mutual NDA**: Both parties share confidential information (partnerships, joint ventures)
- **Unilateral NDA**: One party discloses to the other (employee, contractor, investor pitch)

Collect required details:
- **Disclosing party**: Name, title, company, address
- **Receiving party**: Name, title, company, address
- **Purpose**: Why confidential information is being shared
- **Duration**: How long the confidentiality obligation lasts (typically 1-5 years)
- **Governing law**: Jurisdiction / state for legal enforcement
- **Specific exclusions**: Any carve-outs or exceptions the user wants

### Step 2: Select the appropriate template sections

Every NDA should include these core sections:

1. **Preamble**: Date, party names, purpose statement
2. **Definition of Confidential Information**: What is covered (documents, data, trade secrets, discussions)
3. **Obligations of Receiving Party**: Non-disclosure, limited use, protection standards
4. **Exclusions**: Information that is not covered (publicly available, independently developed, prior knowledge)
5. **Term and Duration**: Effective date, confidentiality period, survival clauses
6. **Return or Destruction**: What happens to materials when the NDA expires
7. **Remedies**: Injunctive relief, damages for breach
8. **General Provisions**: Governing law, jurisdiction, amendments, entire agreement, severability
9. **Signature Block**: Lines for both parties with name, title, date

### Step 3: Generate the document

Create the NDA as a DOCX file (editable) or PDF:

```python
from docx import Document
from docx.shared import Pt, Inches
from docx.enum.text import WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH

def generate_nda(data, output_path="nda.docx"):
    doc = Document()

    # Title
    title = doc.add_heading('NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT', level=0)
    title.alignment = WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH.CENTER

    # Preamble
    doc.add_paragraph(
        f"This Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into as of "
        f"{data['effective_date']} (\"Effective Date\") by and between:"
    )
    doc.add_paragraph(
        f"{data['party_a']['name']}, located at {data['party_a']['address']} "
        f"(\"{'Disclosing Party' if not data['mutual'] else 'Party A'}\")"
    )
    doc.add_paragraph(
        f"{data['party_b']['name']}, located at {data['party_b']['address']} "
        f"(\"{'Receiving Party' if not data['mutual'] else 'Party B'}\")"
    )

    # Add each section with heading and content
    for section in data['sections']:
        doc.add_heading(section['title'], level=1)
        doc.add_paragraph(section['content'])

    # Signature block
    doc.add_heading('SIGNATURES', level=1)
    doc.add_paragraph(f"\n{'_' * 40}\n{data['party_a']['name']}\nTitle: {data['party_a'].get('title', '')}\nDate: _______________")
    doc.add_paragraph(f"\n{'_' * 40}\n{data['party_b']['name']}\nTitle: {data['party_b'].get('title', '')}\nDate: _______________")

    doc.save(output_path)
    return output_path
```

### Step 4: Review and present

After generating:
1. Display a summary of key terms
2. List all sections included
3. Remind the user to have a lawyer review before signing

```

## Guidelines

- Always include a disclaimer that the generated NDA is a template and should be reviewed by legal counsel before execution.
- Default confidentiality duration to 2 years for business partnerships and 3 years post-termination for employment NDAs.
- Generate DOCX format by default so the user can edit the document. Offer PDF as an alternative.
- Use clear, plain language where possible while maintaining legal precision.
- Include standard exclusions in every NDA: publicly available information, independently developed information, information received from third parties, and information disclosed by court order.
- For mutual NDAs, ensure obligations are symmetric and apply equally to both parties.
- Bracketed placeholders like [Company Name] should be used for any information the user has not provided, making it easy to fill in later.
- Install python-docx with `pip install python-docx` if not available.
