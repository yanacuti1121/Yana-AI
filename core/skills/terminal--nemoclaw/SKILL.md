# NemoClaw

## Overview

NemoClaw is an open-source stack by NVIDIA that installs and runs OpenClaw inside a sandboxed environment (OpenShell) with policy-enforced security controls. OpenShell provides Landlock, seccomp, and network namespace isolation. Sandboxes enforce strict egress control — all inference requests route through the OpenShell gateway, not directly to the internet. Network and inference policies are hot-reloadable; filesystem and process policies are locked at creation.

## Instructions

### 1. Install NemoClaw

Prerequisites: Linux Ubuntu 22.04+, Node.js 20+, Docker running, NVIDIA OpenShell installed, NVIDIA API key from build.nvidia.com.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | bash
```

The installer runs the guided onboard wizard, creates a sandbox, configures inference (NVIDIA cloud), and applies security policies. After install you see:

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sandbox my-assistant (Landlock + seccomp + netns)
Model nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b (NVIDIA Cloud API)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 2. Manage sandboxes from the host

```bash
nemoclaw onboard                      # Interactive setup wizard
nemoclaw my-assistant connect         # Shell into sandbox
nemoclaw my-assistant status          # Sandbox health check
nemoclaw my-assistant logs --follow   # Stream logs
nemoclaw start                        # Start auxiliary services
nemoclaw stop                         # Stop services
nemoclaw deploy my-assistant          # Deploy via Brev to remote GPU instance
```

### 3. Work inside the sandbox

```bash
openclaw tui                          # Interactive chat TUI
openclaw agent --agent main --local -m "hello" --session-id test
openclaw nemoclaw launch              # Bootstrap OpenClaw in sandbox
openclaw nemoclaw status              # Show sandbox health
openclaw nemoclaw logs [-f]           # Stream logs
```

### 4. Security policies

- **Network**: All outbound blocked by default, allowlist-based egress, hot-reloadable. When agent requests unlisted host → blocked + surfaced in TUI for operator approval.
- **Filesystem**: Only `/sandbox` and `/tmp` writable, locked at creation.
- **Process**: Privilege escalation blocked, seccomp syscall filtering, locked at creation.
- **Inference**: All model API calls intercepted by OpenShell gateway, routed to NVIDIA cloud. Default model: `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`.

### 5. Troubleshoot

```bash
nemoclaw my-assistant status                        # NemoClaw health
openshell sandbox list                              # OpenShell sandbox state
nemoclaw my-assistant logs --follow | grep inference # Check inference connectivity
```

Common issues: Docker not running → start daemon. API key invalid → re-run `nemoclaw onboard`. Sandbox conflicts → check `openshell sandbox list`. Network blocked → check egress allowlist.

## Examples

### Example 1: Set up a new sandboxed coding agent

**User request:** "I want to run an OpenClaw agent in a secure sandbox with NemoClaw on my Ubuntu server"

**Actions taken:**
1. Verify prerequisites: confirm Ubuntu 22.04+, Node.js 20+, Docker running
2. Install OpenShell from https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell
3. Run the NemoClaw installer:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | bash
   ```
4. Follow onboard wizard — enter sandbox name `code-agent`, select Nemotron model, provide NVIDIA API key
5. Connect to sandbox:
   ```bash
   nemoclaw code-agent connect
   ```
6. Inside sandbox, start the agent TUI:
   ```bash
   openclaw tui
   ```

**Expected output:** Agent running inside isolated sandbox with Landlock filesystem protection, seccomp syscall filtering, network namespace isolation, and all inference routed through OpenShell gateway.

### Example 2: Deploy a sandboxed agent to a remote GPU instance

**User request:** "Deploy my NemoClaw sandbox to a remote GPU so I can run larger models"

**Actions taken:**
1. Confirm local sandbox `research-agent` is working:
   ```bash
   nemoclaw research-agent status
   ```
   Output: `research-agent: running (Landlock + seccomp + netns)`
2. Deploy to remote GPU via Brev:
   ```bash
   nemoclaw deploy research-agent
   ```
3. Monitor remote deployment:
   ```bash
   nemoclaw research-agent logs --follow
   ```

**Expected output:** Remote GPU instance provisioned, NemoClaw installed, sandbox `research-agent` running on remote with same security policies applied. All inference routed through NVIDIA cloud API.

## Guidelines

- NemoClaw requires a **fresh OpenClaw installation** — do not install on existing OpenClaw setups.
- **Alpha software** — APIs may change without notice; not production-ready yet.
- **Linux only** — Ubuntu 22.04+ required, no macOS or Windows support.
- The `curl | bash` installer is from nvidia.com (official NVIDIA source). For manual installation, clone the repo and follow the README at https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw.
- When the agent tries to reach a host not in the egress allowlist, the request is blocked and surfaced in the OpenShell TUI for operator approval. If approved, the host is added to the allowlist.
- Blueprint lifecycle: Resolve artifact → Verify digest → Plan resources → Apply through OpenShell CLI.
- Architecture: Host runs nemoclaw CLI (TypeScript) + Blueprint (Python) + OpenShell Runtime → Sandbox contains the OpenClaw agent with strict isolation.
