# Product Marketing Context

## Overview

You help users create and maintain a product marketing context document. This captures foundational positioning and messaging information that other marketing skills reference, so users don't repeat themselves. The document is stored at `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check for Existing Context

First, check if `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` already exists.

**If it exists:** Read it, summarize what's captured, ask which sections to update, and only gather info for those sections.

**If it doesn't exist, offer two options:**

1. **Auto-draft from codebase** (recommended): Study the repo (README, landing pages, marketing copy, package.json, etc.) and draft a V1. The user reviews, corrects, and fills gaps. This is faster than starting from scratch.
2. **Start from scratch**: Walk through each section conversationally, one at a time.

Most users prefer option 1. After presenting the draft, ask: "What needs correcting? What's missing?"

### Step 2: Gather Information

**If auto-drafting:** Read the codebase (README, landing pages, marketing copy, about pages, meta descriptions, package.json, existing docs), draft all sections, present for review, iterate until satisfied.

**If starting from scratch:** Walk through each section below one at a time. Don't dump all questions at once. For each section: briefly explain what you're capturing, ask relevant questions, confirm accuracy, move to next. Push for verbatim customer language since exact phrases are more valuable than polished descriptions.

### Sections to Capture

**1. Product Overview** - One-line description, what it does (2-3 sentences), product category, product type (SaaS, marketplace, etc.), business model and pricing.

**2. Target Audience** - Target company type (industry, size, stage), target decision-makers (roles, departments), primary use case, jobs to be done (2-3), specific use cases or scenarios.

**3. Personas (B2B only)** - For each stakeholder (User, Champion, Decision Maker, Financial Buyer, Technical Influencer): what they care about, their challenge, and the value you promise them.

**4. Problems & Pain Points** - Core challenge before finding you, why current solutions fall short, what it costs them (time, money, opportunities), emotional tension.

**5. Competitive Landscape** - Direct competitors (same solution, same problem), secondary competitors (different solution, same problem), indirect competitors (conflicting approach). How each falls short.

**6. Differentiation** - Key differentiators (capabilities alternatives lack), how you solve it differently, why that's better, why customers choose you.

**7. Objections & Anti-Personas** - Top 3 objections heard in sales with responses. Who is NOT a good fit.

**8. Switching Dynamics (JTBD Four Forces)** - Push (frustrations with current solution), Pull (what attracts them to you), Habit (what keeps them stuck), Anxiety (worries about switching).

**9. Customer Language** - How customers describe the problem and your solution (verbatim), words/phrases to use, words to avoid, glossary of product-specific terms.

**10. Brand Voice** - Tone, communication style, brand personality (3-5 adjectives).

**11. Proof Points** - Key metrics or results, notable customers/logos, testimonial snippets, main value themes with supporting evidence.

**12. Goals** - Primary business goal, key conversion action, current metrics.

### Step 3: Create the Document

After gathering information, create `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` with clearly labeled sections for each of the 12 areas above. Use structured formatting with bold labels and tables where appropriate (personas table, objections table, glossary table, value themes table).

### Step 4: Confirm and Save

Show the completed document, ask if anything needs adjustment, save to `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`, and tell them: "Other marketing skills will now use this context automatically. Run `/product-marketing-context` anytime to update it."

## Examples

### Example 1: Auto-Draft from a SaaS Codebase

**User prompt:** "Set up my product marketing context."

The agent will check for `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` (doesn't exist), then offer the two options. The user chooses auto-draft. The agent reads README.md, the landing page component, package.json, and any marketing copy in the repo. It drafts a V1 covering all 12 sections based on what it finds, such as:
- Product Overview extracted from README and meta descriptions
- Target Audience inferred from landing page copy and feature descriptions
- Competitive Landscape based on comparison pages or "why us" sections
- Gaps clearly marked with "[needs input]" where the codebase doesn't provide enough info
The agent presents the draft and asks: "What needs correcting? What's missing?" Then iterates until the user approves and saves the file.

### Example 2: Updating an Existing Context Document

**User prompt:** "We just repositioned from targeting freelancers to targeting agencies. Update our product marketing context."

The agent reads the existing `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`, summarizes the current state, and identifies sections that need updating for the repositioning:
- Target Audience: Update from freelancers to agency owners and account managers
- Personas: Replace freelancer persona with agency stakeholders (Agency Owner, Account Manager, Creative Director)
- Problems & Pain Points: Shift from individual productivity to team coordination and client management challenges
- Customer Language: Update verbatim phrases to reflect agency terminology
- Competitive Landscape: Reassess competitors in the agency management space
The agent walks through each affected section, gathers new information, updates the document, and saves.

## Guidelines

- Always check for existing `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` before starting from scratch
- Recommend auto-drafting from the codebase as the default since it is faster and gives users something to react to rather than answering from a blank slate
- Walk through sections one at a time when gathering information, never dump all questions at once
- Push for verbatim customer language since exact phrases customers use are more valuable than polished marketing descriptions
- Mark sections with "[needs input]" when auto-drafting if the codebase does not provide enough information
- Skip sections that don't apply (for example, B2B Personas for a B2C product)
- Validate each section with the user before moving to the next to avoid rework
- Keep the document concise and scannable: use bold labels, short bullet points, and tables for structured data
