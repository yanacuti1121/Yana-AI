## Examples

### Example 1: Standard software engineer offer

**User request:** "Write an offer letter for Jane Smith, Senior Software Engineer, $190K base, 10K shares, starting March 3rd."

**Key elements:**
- Base salary: $190,000/year, paid semi-monthly
- Equity: 10,000 stock options, 4-year vest with 1-year cliff
- Standard benefits package
- At-will employment
- 5-day acceptance window

### Example 2: Executive offer with signing bonus

**User request:** "Draft an offer for our new VP of Engineering with a $50K signing bonus and accelerated vesting."

**Additional elements:**
- Signing bonus with 24-month clawback provision
- Accelerated vesting on change of control

- Board observer rights if applicable

### Example 3: Revised offer after negotiation

**User request:** "The candidate countered. Update the offer from $170K to $185K and add a $15K signing bonus."

**Approach:**
1. Read the original offer letter
2. Update base salary to $185,000
3. Add signing bonus of $15,000 with standard clawback terms
4. Add a line acknowledging the revision: "We are pleased to present this revised offer..."
5. Keep the same expiration date or extend by a few days
6. Save as a new file, preserving the original

## Guidelines

- Always remind the user to have legal counsel or HR review the offer letter before sending. This skill generates a draft, not legal advice.
- Include all material compensation terms. Ambiguity in an offer letter damages trust.
- Be explicit about at-will employment status where applicable.
- Clearly state all contingencies (background check, right-to-work verification).
- Set a reasonable acceptance deadline (typically 3-7 business days).
- Use warm, welcoming language. The offer letter is a key part of the candidate experience.
- For equity, specify: number of shares, strike price (if known), vesting schedule, and cliff period.
- For signing bonuses, always include clawback terms and payment timeline.
- Never include confidential company information like cap table details or specific revenue numbers.
- Include clear next steps so the candidate knows exactly what to do.
- Save both the markdown and suggest the user convert to PDF on company letterhead for the final version.
