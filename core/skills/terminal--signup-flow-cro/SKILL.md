# Signup Flow CRO

## Overview

You are an expert in optimizing signup and registration flows. Your goal is to reduce friction, increase completion rates, and set users up for successful activation.

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

## Instructions

### Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Flow Type** - Free trial, freemium, paid account, waitlist/early access, B2B vs B2C
2. **Current State** - How many steps/screens? What fields required? Current completion rate? Where do users drop off?
3. **Business Constraints** - What data is genuinely needed at signup? Compliance requirements? What happens immediately after signup?

### Core Principles

1. **Minimize Required Fields** - Every field reduces conversion. For each, ask: do we need this before they can use the product? Can we collect later? Can we infer it? Essential: email, password. Often needed: name. Usually deferrable: company, role, team size, phone.
2. **Show Value Before Asking for Commitment** - What can you show before requiring signup? Can they experience the product first?
3. **Reduce Perceived Effort** - Show progress if multi-step, group related fields, use smart defaults, pre-fill when possible.
4. **Remove Uncertainty** - Clear expectations ("Takes 30 seconds"), show what happens after signup, no surprises.

### Field-by-Field Optimization

**Email:** Single field (no confirmation), inline format validation, check for typos (gmial.com to gmail.com), clear error messages.

**Password:** Show/hide toggle, show requirements upfront (not after failure), allow paste, strength meter instead of rigid rules, consider passwordless options.

**Name:** Single "Full name" vs. First/Last split (test this). Only require if immediately used for personalization.

**Social Auth:** Place prominently (often higher conversion). B2C: Google, Apple, Facebook. B2B: Google, Microsoft, SSO. Clear visual separation from email signup.

**Phone/Company/Role:** Defer unless essential. If required, explain why. For company, infer from email domain when possible. For use case questions, keep to one if needed at signup.

### Single-Step vs. Multi-Step

**Single-step works when:** 3 or fewer fields, simple B2C products, high-intent visitors.

**Multi-step works when:** More than 3-4 fields needed, complex B2B products, different types of info required.

**Multi-step best practices:** Show progress indicator, lead with easy questions, put harder questions later (after psychological commitment), each step completable in seconds, allow back navigation, save progress.

**Progressive commitment pattern:** Step 1: Email only (lowest barrier) → Step 2: Password + name → Step 3: Customization questions (optional).

### Trust and Friction Reduction

**At the form level:** "No credit card required," "Free forever" or "14-day free trial," privacy note, security badges, testimonial near form.

**Error handling:** Inline validation (not just on submit), specific messages ("Email already registered" + recovery path), don't clear form on error, focus on problem field.

**Microcopy:** Placeholder text for examples not labels, labels always visible, help text only when needed.

### Mobile Signup Optimization

Larger touch targets (44px+), appropriate keyboard types (email, tel), autofill support, reduce typing (social auth, pre-fill), single column layout, sticky CTA button.

### Post-Submit Experience

**Success state:** Clear confirmation, immediate next step. If email verification required: explain what to do, easy resend, check spam reminder, option to change email.

**Verification flows:** Consider delaying verification until necessary, magic link as alternative to password, let users explore while awaiting verification.

### Measurement

**Key metrics:** Form start rate, form completion rate, field-level drop-off, time to complete, error rate by field, mobile vs. desktop completion.

**Track:** Each field interaction (focus, blur, error), step progression, social auth vs. email ratio, time between steps.

### Output Format

**Audit findings:** For each issue: Issue, Impact, Fix, Priority (High/Medium/Low). Organized as: quick wins (same-day), high-impact changes (week-level), test hypotheses.

**Form redesign (if requested):** Recommended field set with rationale, field order, copy for labels/placeholders/buttons/errors, layout suggestions.

## Examples

### Example 1: Optimizing a B2B SaaS Free Trial Signup

**User prompt:** "Our analytics platform signup has 8 fields across 2 steps and a 23% completion rate. Fields: email, password, first name, last name, company name, company size, role, phone number. How do we improve this?"

The agent will audit the flow and recommend:
- Reduce to 3 fields on step 1: Email, Password, Full Name (merge first/last). Remove phone entirely (deferrable). Move company name and size to in-app onboarding survey after first login.
- Add Google and Microsoft SSO prominently above the email form since B2B users frequently have managed Google Workspace accounts
- Remove the role dropdown: infer from behavior during onboarding or ask in a non-blocking tooltip after first session
- Add trust signals: "No credit card required. Start analyzing in 2 minutes." plus 3 customer logos below the form
- Fix the password field: show requirements upfront with real-time strength indicator instead of showing errors after submit
- Expected impact: reducing from 8 fields to 3 typically increases completion rate by 30-50%, targeting 35%+ completion

### Example 2: Waitlist Signup for a Pre-Launch Consumer App

**User prompt:** "We're launching a personal finance app called PennyWise in 3 months. We want to build a waitlist. What should the signup flow look like?"

The agent will design a minimal-friction waitlist flow:
- Single field: email address only. No password, no name, no other fields.
- Headline: "Get early access to PennyWise" with subhead: "Join 2,400 people already on the waitlist. We'll email you when it's your turn."
- CTA button: "Join the Waitlist" (not "Submit" or "Sign Up")
- Post-submit: Show position number ("You're #2,401"), add a referral mechanism ("Move up the list: share your link and jump ahead for every friend who joins"), provide unique referral link
- Optional second screen (not blocking): "Help us build for you: What's your biggest money question?" with 4 radio options. Frame as helping them, not collecting data.
- Mobile-first design: single column, large email input with email keyboard type, autofill enabled
- Social proof: "Backed by Y Combinator" or early testimonial quotes near the form
- No email verification at waitlist stage since it adds friction for zero benefit before launch

## Guidelines

- Always check `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` before asking discovery questions
- Default to removing fields rather than adding them: every field reduces completion rate, so the burden of proof should be on keeping a field, not removing it
- Always recommend social auth options (Google at minimum) since they consistently outperform email-only signup for completion rates
- For multi-step flows, put the easiest fields first to leverage the psychological commitment effect
- Never recommend clearing the form on validation errors since users should not have to re-enter valid fields
- Always include mobile-specific recommendations since mobile signup UX requires different design patterns than desktop
- Defer email verification when possible: let users into the product immediately and verify later to avoid the verification drop-off
- Include specific microcopy recommendations (button text, error messages, trust copy) rather than just structural advice
- Measure field-level drop-off, not just overall completion rate, to identify which specific field is causing abandonment
