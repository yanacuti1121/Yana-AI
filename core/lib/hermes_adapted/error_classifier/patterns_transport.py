"""Transport/timeout/disconnect message and exception-type patterns.

Origin: NousResearch/hermes-agent agent/error_classifier.py (MIT) — see
        core/lib/hermes_adapted/error_classifier/__init__.py for port notes.

Note: the upstream file also declares ``_THINKING_SIG_PATTERNS = ["signature"]``
but never references it (the thinking-signature check in the main pipeline
matches "signature" inline instead) — omitted here as upstream dead code.

# Message-string patterns that indicate a provider-side timeout even when
# the exception type is generic (e.g. RuntimeError from a local shim that
# wraps a subprocess timeout).  Checked before the type-based transport
# heuristics so custom-provider "timed out" errors don't fall through to
# the unknown bucket and get misreported as empty responses.

# Server disconnect patterns (no status code, but transport-level).
# These are the "ambiguous" patterns — a plain connection close could be
# transient transport hiccup OR server-side context overflow rejection
# (common when the API gateway disconnects instead of returning an HTTP
# error for oversized requests).  A large session + one of these patterns
# triggers the context-overflow-with-compression recovery path.

# SSL/TLS transient failure patterns — intentionally distinct from
# SERVER_DISCONNECT_PATTERNS above.
#
# An SSL alert mid-stream is almost always a transport-layer hiccup
# (flaky network, mid-session TLS renegotiation failure, load balancer
# dropping the connection) — NOT a server-side context overflow signal.
# So we want the retry path but NOT the compression path; lumping these
# into SERVER_DISCONNECT_PATTERNS would trigger unnecessary (and
# expensive) context compression on any large-session SSL hiccup.
#
# The OpenSSL library constructs error codes by prepending a format string
# to the uppercased alert reason; OpenSSL 3.x changed the separator
# (e.g. `SSLV3_ALERT_BAD_RECORD_MAC` → `SSL/TLS_ALERT_BAD_RECORD_MAC`),
# which silently stopped matching anything explicit.  Matching on the
# stable substrings (`bad record mac`, `ssl alert`, `tls alert`, etc.)
# survives future OpenSSL format churn without code changes.
